// accessible globally by attaching them to the `Alloy.Globals`
// object. For example:
//
// Alloy.Globals.someGlobalFunction = function(){};

//AMPM
Alloy.Globals.formatAMPM = function(date){

	  hours = hours ? hours : 12; // the hour '0' should be '12'
	  minutes = minutes < 10 ? '0'+minutes : minutes;
	  var strTime = hours + ':' + minutes + ' ' + ampm;
